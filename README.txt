Functions otherwise use regular JavaScript.

Use cases: 

The page embeds a video and allows the user to create messages at their specified time on the videos by interacting with the blue timeline section.

Users can save and share their annotations via Excel Binary, csv, and plain txt files.



People could use this tool to:
Create their own bookmarks on videos to flip through.
Add notes to a video, to demonstrate or teach something using the video.
Share messages about specified videos.
Share specific sections of videos with additional information.

This tool is easier that creating a whole new video, as all it does is create a file that accompanies a video.

Users can quickly find points of interest of a video and convey why they are interesting with their written messages.

Save messages or cliff-notes about a video to study or share.

Saved files will load the video made for the annotations.
